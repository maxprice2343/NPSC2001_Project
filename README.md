# Using Deep Q Networks to Improve the energy efficiency of Space Air Ground Integrated Networks

## Background
Space Air Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) are a new type of network that integrate satellites, air-based deivces such as drones, and ground-based networking devices.
SAGINs have the potential to overcome some of the common problems with modern networks.  
- Highly Adaptable
- High throughput
- High coverage
- Robust
SAGINs are also facing unique challenges due to their novelty.
- Traffic offloading
- Energy management
- Resource allocation
- Route management
- Signal handover

## Project Aim

### Deep Q Network
Deep Q Learning is concerned with the actions of an agent in an environment.

An environment has several characteristics that constitutes its state. The state of an environment influences the optimal action that the agent should take.  
The goal of this project is to train a neural network (known as a Deep Q Network) that can select the optimal action for the agent based on the environment's state.
